  Run juju inside of juju.
  
  This is a charm to install and manage a juju client.  Use this
  to run the juju cli against environments passed as config.

  As a subordinate, this can enable a juju cli for any service.
  This is typically useful as a subordinate to jenkins-slave for
  charmtesting or to turn byobu-classroom into juju-classroom.

  As a standalone charm, this can be useful when experimenting
  with different environments/providers.
